ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By accessing and using the Lomito platform (lomito.org), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any of these terms, please do not use the platform.

SERVICE DESCRIPTION

Lomito is an open-source civic platform dedicated to reporting and tracking animal welfare cases in Mexico. The platform allows citizens to:

• Report cases of abuse, abandonment, or missing animals
• Geolocate reports on an interactive map
• Track the status of reported cases
• Facilitate communication with competent government authorities
• Consult public impact and transparency metrics

Lomito is operated by volunteers and does not constitute an official government service. We do not replace or substitute the functions of animal welfare authorities.
